Some parts were created w/ chatgpt (im kinda a newbie in python).
So if you know how to simplify it, feel free to do so!

HOW TO USE
===========================================================================================================
Firstly, open the script by executing "python xmriginst.py"
Then, choose your distro*, the script will install depencies (also includes updating and upgrading your system).
Enter your Monero wallet.
Choose a mining pool.
Once everything is set up, navigate to the build directory:
cd ~/xmrig/build
Run the miner:
sudo ./xmrig
If you want to change the mining pool, open the config.json file and change the pool address.
Congrats! You just installed XMRig and ready to mine Monero!


Actually I am not sure if this  will this work on Fedora or Debian. Please let me know if you tested.
*Windows support is still in development, so, you cannot use it yet.
