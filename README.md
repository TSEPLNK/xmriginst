Now works only on Arch, but i want to make it work on another distros. 
Some parts were created w/ chatgpt (im kinda newbie in python).
So if you know how to simplify it, here you go!

HOW TO USE
Firstly, open the cript by executing "python xmriginst.py"
Then, install depencies (also includes updating and upgrading your system).
Write your Monero wallet.
Then, after everything is fine go to 'build' by executing "cd ~/xmrig/build". Now run "./xmrig".
If you want to use another pool, open 'config.json' file and change the pool.
Congrats! You just installed XMRig and good to mine Monero!
