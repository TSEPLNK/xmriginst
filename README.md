If you know how to simplify it, feel free to do so!

HOW TO USE
--------------------------------
Linux version

Firstly, open the script by executing "./linux_xmriginst",

If you already have XMRig installed in "~/xmrig/build", you can change the config by choosing the second variant.

If you want to install XMRig, choose the first variant,

Find your Distro.

Then, it's installing depencies, also updating databases.

Enter your Monero Wallet address.

Choose your pool.

It's compiling XMRig, and here you go! 

After everything is set up, execute 'cd ~/xmrig/build' and then either './xmrig' or 'sudo ./xmrig' for better performance!.

Open the script by double clicking on "windows_xmriginst.exe",

If you already have XMRig installed in "YourUsername/xmrig/", you can change the config by choosing the second variant.

If you want to install XMRig, choose the first variant,

Keep in mind that `xmriginst.py` is now abandoned: use `linux_xmriginst.py` and `windows_xmriginst.py` instead!
